# SEPHackathon

Our entrepreneurship club (SEP) hackathon project, created in just 10 hours, showcases a sample website for a caretaker matchmaking service designed to keep families in the loop on their loved onesâ€™ health. Through real-time updates from caretakers, users can track their parents' medication, health notes, and appointments in one convenient place. This platform simplifies the process of finding trusted care and ensures peace of mind, helping families stay informed no matter where they are.
