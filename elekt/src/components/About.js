      <h1>About ELEKT</h1>
      <p>
        At ELEKT, we believe in empowering lives through compassionate care. Our mission is to illuminate the path to dignity, independence, and joy for elderly individuals and those living with disabilities.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        ELEKT was born from a spark of inspiration: to revolutionize the way we approach caregiving in our rapidly changing world. We recognized a growing need for a modern, efficient, yet deeply human approach to connecting those who need care with those who provide it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our name, ELEKT, embodies our core philosophy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>E</strong>mpowerment</li>
        <li><strong>L</strong>ove</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong>xperience</li>
        <li><strong>K</strong>indness</li>
        <li><strong>T</strong>rust</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These principles guide every aspect of our service, from how we select our caregivers to how we interact with families and clients.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We're Here</h2>
      <p>
        Every day, we're energized by the transformations we witness:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An elderly artist rediscovering her passion with the encouragement of a caregiver who shares her love for painting</li>
        <li>A young man with a disability achieving new levels of independence through personalized, tech-savvy care</li>
        <li>A family finding renewed connection with their aging parent, freed from the stress of full-time caregiving</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These moments of light drive us forward, reminding us of the profound impact that the right care can have on an individual's life and their entire support network.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        ELEKT is more than a caregiving platform; we're a community dedicated to illuminating lives. We use cutting-edge technology to make connections, but our heart lies in the human touch that our carefully selected caregivers provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We go beyond just matching skills; we connect hearts and minds. Our rigorous vetting process ensures that our caregivers are not only qualified but also align with our core values of empathy, respect, and dedication.
      </p>
